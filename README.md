## Objective

We want to answer a very basic question: can we distinguish those 4 particle species based on the pattern of energy release in an arbitrarily granular device? And if so, how does the size of the cells affect this capability?
The $\textbf{«money plot»}$ is thus one where we put on the y axis some measures of discrimination (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/4 or some combination of the six) and on the x axis the cell size, so we can find out whether there is merit in keeping the cell size below the value when information is irrecoverable.
